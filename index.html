            <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
            <p>My name is Kirima Murungi and am currently a student a Moringa School.
              I have a few months working with code and so far so good. I have a KCSE certificate issued by the government of Kenya.
              I love watching movies, the best one yet being <em>Deadpool</em>,
              cant wait for the second one. I also love coding especially during my free time.
              I got into coding bacause i wanted to build cool websites and discovered a whole world of possibilities as i
              progressed on. Thank you for going through this page.</p>

          <p>  <br>This is my first website so dont judge me. I was new to this and honestly i was very excited to see something work
            on a webpage.<br><br><em><strong>"You never forget your first"</strong></em></p>

          </a>
          <p><br>This was my second website so yes, you can start to judge me now.
            It was a challenge working on this one but i learnt alot from it.

          <p><br>This was my third and it was tough.
            At this point i was starting to think i could do just fine without javascript
            so go easy on me.
